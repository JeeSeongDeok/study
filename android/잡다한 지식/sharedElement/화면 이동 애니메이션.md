The issue was how the activity backstack was declared in the android manifest. First of all, the parent and child activities must be declared for proper back-navigation:

<activity
        android:name=".ui.activity.HomeActivity"
        android:label="@string/app_name" >
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
    <activity android:name=".ui.activity.DetailActivity"
        android:launchMode="singleTask"
        android:parentActivityName=".ui.activity.HomeActivity"
        android:label="@string/app_name">
        <meta-data
            android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
            android:value="ui.activity.HomeActivity"/>
</activity>
Second, the child activity must have a launch mode of "singleTask". I had previously set this as "singleInstance". The difference is that the latter is always the only member of it's task. If you minimize your application while on this child fragment and resume it later, the back button won't remember your parent activity.

Both parent activity navigation and sceneTransitionAnimation work with a singleTask launchMode attribute.
